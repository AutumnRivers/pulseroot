PulseRoot is a chat application that focuses on reliability, speed, and most of all... **security**.  
It allows you to enter the global chat as either a guest, or gives you the ability to make an account.

With an account, you can:
* Private message other users
* Have your own profile
* Integrate with other services (Twitter, Discord, Google, etc.)

### Socket.io
PulseRoot utilizes socket.io for messaging.
