				<h1>PulseRoot Administration Rules</h1>
				<h2>Read em and weep, boys.</h2>
				<hr/>
				<h3>1. No unjustified banning/deletion</h3>
				<p>Users like being on PulseRoot! As such, they don't want their account to suddenly cease to exist, or to find they can suddenly no longer log into their account! If you're going to ban or delete a user, you better have a pretty darn good reason.</p>
				<h3>2. Treat users with respect</h3>
				<p>You're a user, I'm a user, we're all users. So let's treat each other with respect, shall we? Gotta set a good example for the kiddos.</p>
				<h3>3. No abusing admin powers</h3>
				<p>Sorry to say, but no fun allowed when it comes to administrative duties. Don't go changing a user's avatar to a picture of a duck, or changing a user's profile description to say "I LIEK FORTNUT" First off, it's immature, and it's stupid. You are expected to take your job seriously. If you want to ruin your own account from the admin dashboard, then be my guest. But no messing with users unless you need to!</p>
				<h3>4. Pass your uncertainties to a higher power</h3>
				<p>Typically, that's me. If you aren't sure if you should change something about a user, then contact me. If you believe you should delete a user, ban them until I can look. Unbanning a user is very easy - but once a user is <i>deleted</i>, they're gone. Outta here, no coming back. Admittedly, I should make deleting users dev-only, but I trust you with this power.</p>
				<h3>5. Use common sense</h3>
				<p>You're an admin because I trust you. Please, for fuck's sake, don't prove me wrong. Take this seriously, and think with your head.</p>
